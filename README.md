# Potato Generating - DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)

The purpose of the Potato GAN is to introduce the concepts behind basic image generation using a simple implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. We will detail a basic example of training DCGANs to reproduce images of a single class, exploring the concepts related to how GANs work in general.
